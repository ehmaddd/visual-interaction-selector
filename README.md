# Interactive Webpage Interaction Tracker

This is a simple web application that allows users to interact with a mock webpage and track user interactions. The application highlights interactive elements, records user interactions, and displays a dashboard with interaction data.

## Approach

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of the following key components:

1. **HTML (index.html):** The HTML file defines the mock webpage with interactive elements, a dashboard to display interaction data, and includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

2. **CSS (styles.css):** The CSS file provides styling for the webpage and adds visual indicators when elements are selected for tracking.

3. **JavaScript (script.js):** The JavaScript file handles the main functionality of the application, including toggling selection mode, marking/unmarking elements, simulating events, and updating the dashboard.

## Challenges Faced

While building this application, some challenges were faced, including:

1. **Maintaining Element Selection:** Ensuring that selected elements remained highlighted and that users could easily unselect them when needed.

2. **Tracking and Displaying Interactions:** Keeping track of interaction counts for each selected element and displaying this data in a clear and organized way on the dashboard.

## How to Run and Test the Solution

To run and test the solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. To enter the selection mode, press the "S" key on your keyboard. In selection mode, you can click on interactive elements to mark them for tracking.

4. To unselect an element, simply click on it again while in selection mode.

5. Interact with the webpage by clicking on different interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, videos, dropdowns) to simulate events.

6. The interaction data will be displayed on the dashboard, showing the count of interactions for each selected element.

7. To exit the selection mode, press the "S" key again. This will clear the selection and exit the selection mode.

8. You can test various scenarios by selecting, unselecting, and interacting with different elements to observe how the application tracks and displays interaction data.
